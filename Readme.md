# Python DS & Algorithms

A collection of well-documented Python implementations for essential data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Clean and concise Python code.
- Detailed explanations and comments for better understanding.
- Comprehensive coverage of data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (BFS, DFS).

## Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qudratullah0708/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-DSA-Implementation-in-Python.git
   cd your-repository

##Code Structure

- **linkedlist**: Implementation of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular).
- **stack**: Implementation of a stack.
- **queue**: Implementation of a queue.
- **deque**: Implementation of a deque.
- **priority_queue**: Implementation of a priority queue using both list and linked list.
- **trees**: Implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST).
- **graph**: Implementation of Graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS).
